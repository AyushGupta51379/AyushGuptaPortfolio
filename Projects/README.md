# Capstone Research project – ‘A Computational Comparison of Sorting Algorithms’ (September 2018 - December 2019)

Compared sorting algorithms based on their performance on real randomly generated datasets of size up to 10 million entries.

Compared the results with that of previous researchers. Found that computational methods generate greater insights than theoretical methods. Potential impact of improving the method of comparison from theoretical to computational.

# Machine Learning Language Model – Predicting last token given a sequence of words (September 2018- December 2018)

Implemented algorithm using lstm layers for neural network model, used python programming language.

Split the training dataset of 100K entries into 80K for training set and 20K for validation set. Trained the model on training set and then tuned the hyper-parameters on validation set.

The hyper-parameters varied include epoch, batch size, embedding dimensions, hidden size, drop rate, recurrent drop rate, number of lstm layers.
